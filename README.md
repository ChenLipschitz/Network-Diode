# Data-Diode

### What is a Data Diode?
A data diode is a unidirectional network communication device that enables the safe, one-way transfer of data between segmented networks.
 Data diode design maintains physical and electrical separation of source and destination networks, 
establishing a non-routable, completely closed one-way data transfer between networks. 
Data diodes effectively eliminate external points of entry to the sending system, preventing intruders and contagious elements from infiltrating the network. 
Securing all of a networkâ€™s data outflow with data diodes makes it impossible for an insecure or hostile network
to pass along malware, access your system, or accidentally make harmful changes. (for more info click <a href=https://owlcyberdefense.com/blog/what-is-data-diode-technology-how-does-it-work/> here </a>).
